# PythonTricks
I will use this directory to store my practice scripts of the python tricks that Dan Bader provides in his book: [PYTHON TRICKS THE BOOK, A Buffet of Awesome Python Features](https://realpython.com/products/python-tricks-book/). 

I will also store some of his other code examples within this directory as well.
